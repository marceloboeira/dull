## Performance

### Single threaded

The performance on a single-thread is quite interesting, considering it has to handle each connection sequentially.

`Î» echo "GET http://127.0.0.1:7878/" | vegeta attack -duration=1m -rate=500 | vegeta report`

```
Requests      [total, rate]            30000, 500.00
Duration      [total, attack, wait]    1m7.909608939s, 59.999667s, 7.909941939s

### Multi threaded

#### 3 threads

Less failures, same response time metrics, almost same await.

#### 5 threads

Less failures, more await time and better max (longest request).
